# mentor_codetivate_hackathon

The project is built using Flutter for web for the 2021 codetivate hackathon. The  project showcases the power of flutter un UI design and it includes intergration with Firebase for authentication. I was hoping to intergrate cloud firestore but I was short of time and I will be doing this in the near future.

The project was built for the [Codetivate Hackathon](https://codetivate.devpost.com/?ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=your-open-hackathons&ref_content=Submissions+open) hosted by[The Dynamics](https://the-dynamics.org/). I would like to thank The dynamics for the wonderful opportunity to work on the project and for all the fun experiences I had in the hackathons duration. Despite the additional time I was still not able to archieve what I envisioned for the app but I promised myself to present what I had and these is it. 

For those who are using the project to learn I will be working on the code readerbility to help you easily use the project.

I will also be finishing up the project soon enough.
